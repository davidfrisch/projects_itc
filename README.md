## Assignment 2 - Javascript - Fibonacci Project

The objective of the second project was to create our first front-end website capable of calculating the Fibonacci value of a certain number locally or from a request to a server. We also needed to retrieve the history of previous calculated values requested from the server and display them as a list.

In addition, for the experienced junior developpers, we took our first steps into the back-end. We had to create the fibonacci server which should be able to do the following things: 

- Fulfill the client's request to calculate the fibonacci value and return it to the client. 
- Save the request in a MongoDB database. 
- Send the history of the client old queries.

Keywords:

- Javscript
- async/await and Promises
- Bootstrap

Back-end

- MongoDB
