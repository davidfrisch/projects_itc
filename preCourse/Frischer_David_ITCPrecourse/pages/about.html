        <h2 class="h2-why-like-cloding">Why I like coding ?</h2>
        <p>
          The reason I like coding is because it is the right balance for me
          between play and work. I hope that one day, through the programs I
          make, society can become better.

          My personal experience with coding
        </h2>
        <p class="p-personnal-experience">
          I started coding at the age of 18. Until today, I have written
          programs in these different languages:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Java</li>
          <li>C</li>
          <li>Haskell</li>
          <li>Erlang</li>
          <li>Python</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Since a few days, I started to learn Javscript to become a Full Stack
          programmer!

        <h3>Ecole Nouvelle de la Suisse Romande</h3>
        <p class="p-my-education">
          From the age of 12 to 18, I did my compulsory schooling at the Ecole
          Nouvelle de la Suisse Romande. It was a medium-sized school where I
          met some good friends with whom I am still in contact today.

        <h3>University of Fribourg</h3>
        <p>
          I did my Bachelor in Computer Science at the University of Fribourg
          for 3 years. I took many courses such as: Design Patterns,
          Introduction to Databases, Algorithms and even a Machine Learning
          course.

          There are many activities I like to do. Like skiing, surfing, hiking,

          But what I like most is eating and drinking coffee.

      <h1>Where I was born</h1>
      <p>
        I was born in Paris on a Sunday 7 December 1997. My mother often tells
        me that when she was about to give birth, she had to take an emergency
        taxi to the hospital and almost gave birth on the Place de la Concorde.
