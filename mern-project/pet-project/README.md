In this final project, the aim is to build a complete pet adoption platform with search, user/adoption management and administration dashboard.
The platform needs to be able to allow users to register, search and adopt pets.

To bring a geeky feel to the project. I personally decided that the pets should be Pokemon from the Pokemon universe
